# MercuryLang *version 2.0.1 binary* is out! ✨
## What's in this update? 👀

## 1) New Compiler called Mercury Virtual Machine (MVM) 💻
### What's is MVM? 🔎
* MVM is a compiler that compile low level programing language make for execute Mercury codes 🤯
### What MVM can do 🎁 
* MVM can do a basic codes like what a basic low level programing language can do for example:
```MVM
PROGRAM_START
PUSH_FLOAT 1.000000
PUSH_FLOAT 1.000000
BINARY_ADD
PROGRAM_END
```
* That code is the compiled code of:
``` MercuryLang
1+1
```
### Why use MVM? ✅
* Using MVM to execute code is faster and easier to manage the code 🔒
* By not straight code from AST to value can not cause a lot of error when new version update ❌
## 2) How to compile code into MVM code? ♻️
* 1) Install the language if you are not install go to the offical page for more info
* 2) Make a ```.mer``` file and write code into it
* 3) Open cmd, go to your file path and type ```./shell.exe name_of_your_file.mer```
* 4) When done the MVM will automaticly compiled your ```.mer``` file into ```.merc``` file, that file will be your bytecode
* 5) If you want to execute code type ```./exec.exe your_bytecode_file.merc``` and it will show the output

**And that are all the feature that the 2.0.1 MercuryLang has, have fun coding 😆**
