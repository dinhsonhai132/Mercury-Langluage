# MercuryLang *version 2.0.1 binary* is out! âœ¨
## What's in this update? ðŸ‘€

## 1) New Compiler called Mercury Virtual Machine (MVM) ðŸ’»
### What's is MVM? 
* MVM is a compiler that compile low level programing language make for execute Mercury codes 
### What MVM can do? 
* MVM can do a basic codes like what a basic low level programing language can do for example:
```MVM
PROGRAM_START
PUSH_FLOAT 1.000000
PUSH_FLOAT 1.000000
BINARY_ADD
PROGRAM_END
```
* That code is the compiled code of:
``` MercuryLang
1+1
```
### Why use MVM? 
* Using MVM to execute code is faster and easier to manage the code 
* By not straight code from AST to value can not cause a lot of error when new version update or small mistake run code 
## 2) How to compile code into MVM code? â™»
* First, install the program language, extract all files
* Then, open terminal enter the ../v2.0.1 path
* Run ```make``` to make mer.exe file
* When done, creat a folder named *Mercury* in C:/
* Edit evironment path to your C:/Mercury folder
* When done go to terminal type ```mer --version``` if it show 2.0.1 that means you are done

**And that are all the feature that the 2.0.1 MercuryLang has, have fun coding ðŸ˜†**
