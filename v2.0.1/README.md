# MercuryLang *version 2.0.1 binary* is out! âœ¨
## What's in this update? ðŸ‘€

## 1) New Compiler called Mercury Virtual Machine (MVM) ðŸ’»
### What's is MVM? 
* MVM is a compiler that compile low level programing language make for execute Mercury codes 
### What MVM can do? 
* MVM can do a basic codes like what a basic low level programing language can do for example:
```c++
PROGRAM_START
PUSH_FLOAT 1.000000
PUSH_FLOAT 1.000000
BINARY_ADD
PROGRAM_END
```
* That code is the compiled code of:
``` mercury
1+1
```
### Why use MVM? 
* Using MVM to execute code is faster and easier to manage the code 
* By not straight code from AST to value can not cause a lot of error when new version update or small mistake run code 
## 2) How to install and setup new version?
* First, install the program language, extract all files to your ```C:\```
* Second, open terminal and go to your ```v2.0.1``` MercuryLang file
* Third, run make to make ```mer.exe``` and ```merc.exe```
* Finally, edit environment part to your ```C:\MercuryLang-main\v2.0.1\usr\bin```
* Now you can open terminal and type ```mer --version``` or ```merc --version``` if it show ```2.0.1``` mean you are right
* Plus you can run ```merc main.merc``` to run code or ```merc --run main.merc``` to see the evaluated result
